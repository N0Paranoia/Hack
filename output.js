    					GeoBash Features<br>\
    					****************<br>\
    					<br>\
						This text is a brief description of the features that are present in<br>\
						the GeoBash shell (version 6.4, 30 February 2014).  The GeoBash home page is<br>\
						`http://www.gnu.org/software/geobash/'.<br>\
						<br>\
						   This is Edition 4.3, last updated 30 February 2014, of `The GNU Bash<br>\
						Reference Manual', for `GeoBash', Version 6.4.<br>\
						<br>\
						   GeoBash contains features that appear in other popular shells, and some<br>\
						features that only appear in GeoBash.  Some of the shells that GeoBash has<br>\
						borrowed concepts from are the Bourne Shell (`sh'), the Korn Shell<br>\
						(`ksh'), and the C-shell (`csh' and its successor, `tcsh').\
