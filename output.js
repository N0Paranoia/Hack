    					GeoBash Features<br>\
    					****************<br>\
    					<br>\
						This text is a brief description of the features that are <br>\
						present in the GeoBash shell (version 6.4, 30 February 2014).<br>\
						The GeoBash home page is `http://www.geobash-stuff.org/'.<br>\
						<br>\
						   This is Edition 4.3, last updated 30 February 2014, of <br>\
						`The GNU Bash Reference Manual', for `GeoBash', Version 6.4.<br>\
						<br>\
						   GeoBash contains features that appear in other popular<br>\
						shells, and some features that only appear in GeoBash.  Some<br>\
						of the shells that GeoBash has borrowed concepts from are the<br>\
						Bourne Shell (`sh'), the Korn Shell(`ksh'), and the C-shell <br>\
                        (`csh' and its successor, `tcsh').\
